nFalldown

About:
This is a game for the TI-nSpire!  It works on the TI-NSpire CX CAS and the TI-NSpire with ndless 3.1.  It is really simple to play; just keep moving the bal left and right such that the ball stays on the screen.  Meanwhile lines will push the ball upwards.  If you go up too high the game is over.  Try to get the highest score you can!

How to put on calculator:
Start up TI-NSpire Student Software or whatever you use to put it on the calculator.  Then just drag-n-srop the nFalldown-sdl.tns file into the application to transfer it to your calculator.  You have to have ndless 3.1 on your calculator in order to run it!

How to play:
Navigate the menu using the arrow keys (or 2 and 8 keys) and the Enter key to start a new game.
Use the arrow keys (or 4 and 6 keys) to move the ball left and right
You can use the 'p' key to pause/unpause.
Continue moving the ball as desired for as long as you can.  Hopefully you get a new highscore.  Play another game if you would like!

A highscore file is created in the same directory as the program.

Source:
I included my source.  I programmed with C++ which you can find out more here: http://blog.tangrs.id.au/?p=712  It uses nSDL as well as the ndless Software Development Kit.
